Yesterday, <PERSON> and I went to the park .  On our way
to the <ADJECTIVE> park, we saw a <ADJECTIVE> <NOUN>
on a bike .  We also saw a big <ADJECTIVE> balloon tied
to a <NOUN> .  Once we got to the <ADJECTIVE>
park, the sky turned <ADJECTIVE> .  It started to <VERB> and
<VERB> .  <PERSON> and I <VERB> all the way home.
Tomorrow we will try to go to the <ADJECTIVE> park again and
hope it doesn't <VERB> .
